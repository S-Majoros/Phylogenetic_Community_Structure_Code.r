# Phylogenetic_Community_Structure_Code.r

The purpose of this repository is to develop a pipline in R that will determine the phylogenetic community structure of families using net relatedness index and nearest taxon index, as well as analyze the phylogenetic community structure in relation to the traits of the families using an ANOVA and phylogenetic generalized least squares analysis. This pipeline was originally used for Coleoptera, but can be used for any taxa avaliable on the Barcode of Life Database.
